# Introduction

Stan (Polish for "state") builds on ideas from [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org) and [Jotai](https://jotai.org), without getting bogged down by questionable extras that often compromise clean software practices. Instead of chasing edge cases, it focuses on proven, battle-tested patterns. Despite its minimal footprint, itâ€™s fully capable of handling everything from your TODO lists to the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.

Highlights:

- Synchronous and asynchronous state
- Derived state
- [Caching](./guides/caching)
- Composability
- Provider-less, key-less design
- [Framework-agnostic](./getting-started/frameworks)
