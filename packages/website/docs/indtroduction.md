# Introduction

Stan (Polish for "state") builds on ideas from [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org) and [Jotai](https://jotai.org), without getting bogged down by questionable extras that often compromise clean software practices. Instead of chasing edge cases, it focuses on proven, battle-tested patterns. Despite its minimal footprint, it's fully capable of handling everything from your TODO lists to the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.

Highlights:

- Fully type-safe
- Synchronous and assynchronous state
- Derived state
- Configurable cache
- Composability
- Framework-agnostic
