# Examples

:::info
All examples were built using [create-vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite). Once you clone the [repository](https://github.com/rkrupinski/stan), simply install the dependencies and run the "dev" script (e.g. `yarn dev`) from the example's root directory.
:::

The following examples are available:

1. [atom-effects](https://github.com/rkrupinski/stan/tree/master/packages/examples/atom-effects) - initialize and persist `atom` values using `localStorage`.
2. [asynchronous-state](https://github.com/rkrupinski/stan/tree/master/packages/examples/asynchronous-state) - build a deeply nested, asynchronous state graph.
3. [error-handling](https://github.com/rkrupinski/stan/tree/master/packages/examples/error-handling) - see how rejected promises are handled.
4. [complex-state](https://github.com/rkrupinski/stan/tree/master/packages/examples/complex-state) - level up with multiple dependencies.
5. [caching](https://github.com/rkrupinski/stan/tree/master/packages/examples/caching) - apply cache policies to optimize network traffic.
6. [aborting-work](https://github.com/rkrupinski/stan/tree/master/packages/examples/aborting-work) - abort work with Stan-provided `AbortSignal`.
