At its core, Stan is framework-agnostic. It makes no assumptions about the consuming framework and can, in theory, work with any of them. To make your life easier, Stan comes bundled with some framework bindings out of the box:

- [React](https://react.dev) bindings under `@rkrupinski/stan/react` ([view docs](../api/react.md))
- More to come&hellip;
