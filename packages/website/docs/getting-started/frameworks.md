# Frameworks

At its core, Stan is framework-agnostic. It makes no assumptions about the consuming framework and can, in theory, work with any of them. It's also perfectly fine to use it without any framework (see [examples](./examples.md)). To make things easier, Stan comes bundled with some framework bindings out of the box:

- [React](https://react.dev) bindings under `@rkrupinski/stan/react` ([view docs](../api/react.md))
- More to come&hellip;
