# State

At the core of Stan is state. All Stan APIs either create, update, or consume state. To keep things interesting, there are actually different types of state. Stan represents them as follows:

```ts
interface State<T> {
  tag?: string;
  get(): T;
  subscribe(callback: (value: T) => void): () => void;
}

interface ReadonlyState<T> extends State<T> {
  [REFRESH_TAG](): void;
}

interface WritableState<T> extends State<T> {
  set: SetterOrUpdater<T>;
  [RESET_TAG](): void;
}
```

Stan does not care about the type of value being stored, nor does it behave differently depending on the value type (with one small exception - see the [error handling guide](../guides/error-handling.md)).

## `State<T>`

Nothing in Stan directly produces `State<T>`, but all other state types inherit from it.

It comes with the following properties:

- `tag?` - An optional string identifier. It doesn't affect the state lifecycle but can be useful for debugging.
- `get` - A function that returns the current state value.
- `subscribe` - Allows listening for state changes. It takes a callback function that's called with the new value and returns an unsubscribe function.

## `WritableState<T>`

Produced by:

- [`atom`](./atom.md)
- [`atomFamily`](./atomFamily.md)

This is a state that can be both read from and written to. It is eagerly evaluated.

It inherits all properties from [`State<T>`](#statet), and additionally defines:

- `set` - A function for updating the state value.
- `[RESET_TAG]` - A function that resets the state.

  - Reverts the state value to its default.
  - Notifies all subscribers about the change.

  Important: This function is not meant to be called directly (see [utils](./utils.md#reset)).

:::info
`WritableState<T>` must be initialized before use. Initialization occurs when the state is first read.
:::

## `ReadonlyState<T>`

Produced by:

- [`selector`](./selector.md)
- [`selectorFamily`](./selectorFamily.md)

As the name implies, this is a state that can only be read from. However, that doesn't mean it cannot change â€” it absolutely can:

- When it's refreshed (see [utils](./utils.md#refresh))
- When its dependencies change (see [`selector`](./selector.md))
- When its input changes (see [`selectorFamily`](./selectorFamily.md))

:::info
`ReadonlyState<T>` is considered initialized once its value has been read. If the value has not yet been read, the state is considered uninitialized. The state is not evaluated before initialization.
:::

:::info
`ReadonlyState<T>` is considered mounted when it has one or more subscribers, and unmounted when it has none. Mounting affects how the state is refreshed (see [utils](./utils.md#refresh)).
:::

It inherits all properties from [`State<T>`](#statet), and additionally defines:

- `[REFRESH_TAG]` - A function that refreshes the state.

  - When called on a mounted state, it re-evaluates the state immediately.
  - When called on an unmounted state, it marks the state as uninitialized - meaning it will be re-evaluated the next time it's read.

  Important: This function is not meant to be called directly (see [utils](./utils.md#refresh)).
